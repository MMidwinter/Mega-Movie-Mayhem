# Project Title: Mega Movie Mayhem
Team Members: 
David Lucey, Matt Midwinter, Tanner Riebel, Roberto Pupo
## Project Description / Overview: 
* Our goal is to analyze this data set of movies to identify both elements of the movies themselves, and the quality of movies on various platforms.
## Research Questions to Answer:
* All: Do movies aimed at 18+ age have a higher IMDB rating? 
  * Hypothesis: Movies under 18 will have a higher imdb rating
* Matt: Which decade has the highest ratings (300 movies minimum)?
* Tanner: Do movies on multiple streaming platforms have higher ratings?
  * Hypothesis: Movies that have been on multiple streaming platforms have a higher rating
* Roberto: What kind of movies (genre) receive higher ratings?

* David: Which streaming platform has the highest average ratings?
  * Hypothesis: Movies on Disney plus have the highest ratings of the 4 platforms

## Datasets: 
* The dataset we are looking to use is located on Kaggle and is a list of movies with review scores from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes. This file also lists whether the movie is on Netflix, Huli, Prime Video or Disney +. This file will require some mild cleaning, but appears to be of good quality.
